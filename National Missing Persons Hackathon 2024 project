# National Missing Persons Hackathon 2024 - OSINT Tools and Techniques

This repository showcases my work from the **National Missing Persons Hackathon 2024**, where our team proudly placed **3rd**. The hackathon focused on leveraging Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques to gather actionable insights that could assist in locating missing persons. This repository contains the tools, resources, and methodologies we used, and aims to serve as a helpful foundation for future participants or investigators in similar projects.

## Objectives
- Utilize OSINT tools to analyze publicly available data sources effectively.
- Collaborate with a team to generate insights that could potentially aid investigations.
- Document and provide resources to guide future participants in the application of OSINT methods.


This structure organizes resources to assist users in setting up and utilizing OSINT tools and methodologies for their projects.

## Tools & Techniques Used
- **Python**: Used for scripting, data parsing, and analysis.
- **Maltego**: An OSINT and forensics tool that allows for data mining and link analysis to map out complex networks of relationships.
- **SpiderFoot**: Automated OSINT tool used to gather intelligence on IPs, domain names, emails, and other entities.
- **Google Dorks**: Advanced search queries to find specific information indexed by Google, useful for uncovering hidden data.
- **Public Databases**: Various public data sources, including social media and news platforms, to cross-reference information.

## Key Challenges & Solutions
During the hackathon, we encountered several challenges, such as filtering irrelevant data and navigating privacy considerations. Our solutions included:
- **Applying targeted keywords and search filters** to enhance data relevance.
- **Dividing research areas among team members** to improve efficiency and validate findings collaboratively.

## Hackathon Highlights
- **Placement**: 3rd Place in the National Missing Persons Hackathon 2024.
- **Achievements**: Successfully implemented OSINT techniques to identify potential leads using a range of public data sources, demonstrating the effectiveness of a structured OSINT approach in time-sensitive scenarios.

## For Future Users
This repository is intended to support future OSINT investigations. To get started:
1. **Consult the `docs/` folder** for detailed guidance on OSINT tools and methodologies.
2. **Utilize the `scripts/` folder** for example scripts that can be adapted to specific data collection needs.
3. **Review the `results/` folder** for sample insights generated from OSINT analysis.
